Your task is to analyze the user's persona data and the post content, then extract ONLY the persona elements that are directly relevant to this specific post. Be selective and focused - don't include everything, only what enhances this particular post's authenticity and engagement.

ANALYSIS APPROACH:
1. Look at the post content/topic and identify what persona elements would naturally relate
2. Extract only the relevant information from these persona file sections:
   - basic_info (if relevant to context)
   - about_me (key relevant parts)
   - education (if educational context relates)
   - experience (work/research experience that connects)
   - past_experience (if relevant achievements/activities)
   - skills (technical skills that relate to the post)
   - certifications_and_courses (if relevant to topic)
   - interests (if they connect to the post)
   - values_and_goals (values demonstrated or goals aligned)
   - communication_preferences (always relevant for tone/style)
   - achievements (if they add credibility to this post)

3. Be selective - only include persona elements that genuinely enhance THIS post
4. Extract the exact information as it appears in the persona file
5. Don't invent or add information not present in the persona

Output focused JSON format with only relevant extracted information:

    "relevant_persona_context": {
        "basic_info": {

        "relevant_education": {
